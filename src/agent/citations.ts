// Citation validation for the verdict agent (D04 T01 §5; design spec 4.6, the evidence-or-nothing rule).

// empty or names an ID the case does not have is refused here, as is an explanation whose sentences make
// claims without a marker, whose markers name no case ID, or whose markers disagree with the declared
// citations. Findings are plain, bounded strings: they are what the one retry shows the model, and what a
// refusal records.
